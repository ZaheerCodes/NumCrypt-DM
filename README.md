# NumCrypt-DM
NumCrypt is a beginner-friendly tool for exploring number systems and ASCII-versions of text. It supports conversion between Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal, and offers a simple encryption-decryption process where your message is converted into ASCII, then encoded into a selected base. While, decryption is handled by reversing the process.
